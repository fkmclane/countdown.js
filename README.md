countdown.js

A small (less than .5 KB) javascript library for creating a customizable timer on the page. It includes two versions, one for counting down a specified number of seconds and one for counting down to a date.

The source files are located in the `src` folder and the minified javascript files are located in the `min` folder.

Disclaimer
----------
This library isn't particularly fancy and should not be relied on for an accuracy of more than one second.
